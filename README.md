# Path Planning with the A* Algorithm

## Description

The [A* Algotihm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm) is used widely to traverse a graph between nodes and finding the optimal path. It is also extensively used for Robot Path Planning. For a given Obstacle Space, this program applies the A* Algorithm for Path Planning in order to find the optimal path for the robot to travel from a given initial potiion to a given goal position taking into consideration all the obstacles, the clearance space around them as well as the radius of the robot.

## Approach

## Output

* The 2D Obstacle Space where the Obstacled are shown in red and a clearance space around the obstacles is shown in yellow.
